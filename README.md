### Flutter Apps

- [Meal App](https://github.com/kei-2k3/meal-app) - Meal App was built by following [Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/). I enhanced the learning process by adding personalized notes and experimenting with concepts to deepen my understanding of Flutter and Dart development.
- [H3 Fashion Studio](https://github.com/kei-2k3/h3-studio) - A web application showcasing a curated collection of clothing items. Currently, the app supports item display functionality. The project leverages a Flask API for backend operations and Riverpod for state management on the frontend.
